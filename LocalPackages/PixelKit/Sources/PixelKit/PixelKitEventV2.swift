/// New version of this protocol that allows us to maintain backwards-compatibility with PixelKitEvent
///
/// This new implementation seeks to unify the handling of standard pixel parameters inside PixelKit.
/// The starting example of how this can be useful is error parameter handling - this protocol allows
/// the implementer to speciy an error without having to know about the parametrization of the error.
///
/// The reason this wasn't done directly in `PixelKitEvent` is to reduce the risk of breaking existing
/// pixels, and to allow us to migrate towards this incrementally.
///
public protocol PixelKitEventV2: PixelKitEvent {
    var error: Error? { get }
}

/// Protocol to support mocking pixel firing.
///
/// We're adding support for `PixelKitEventV2` events strategically because adding support for earlier pixels
/// would be more complicated and time consuming.  The idea of V2 events is that fire calls should not include a lot
/// of parameters.  Parameters should be provided by the `PixelKitEventV2` protocol (extending it if necessary)
/// and the call to `fire` should process those properties to serialize in the requests.
///

// App Store app target's PRODUCT_NAME is "DuckDuckGo App Store"
// ("DuckDuckGo App Store Review" for Product Review build).
// It's required to keep it different from non-App Store target
// because otherwise Xcode gets confused: it would make unit tests
// targets depend on both app targets and require both to be built
// before unit tests are compiled, and would immediately fail due
// to the same output files being generated by 2 targets.
//
// For Release build we still need to keep "DuckDuckGo" name. This
// is handled automatically by archive.sh, fastlane and GitHub Actions,
// but in rare cases when the release has to be done manually from
// Xcode, this additional setting is required.
//
// Uncomment the line below when making App Store Release manually from Xcode:
//RELEASE_PRODUCT_NAME_OVERRIDE = DuckDuckGo

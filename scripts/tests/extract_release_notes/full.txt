Release notes

    You can now find browser windows listed in the "Window" app menu and in the Dock menu.
    We also added "Duplicate Tab" to the app menu so you can use it as an action in Apple Shortcuts.
    When watching videos in Duck Player, clicking endscreen recommendations will now open those videos in the same tab.
    The bug that duplicated sites in your browsing history has been fixed, and the visual glitching that sometimes occurred during session restore and app launch has been addressed.

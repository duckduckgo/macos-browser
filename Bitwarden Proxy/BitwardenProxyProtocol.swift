/*
 To use the service from an application or other process, use NSXPCConnection to establish a connection to the service by doing something like this:

     let connectionToService = NSXPCConnection(serviceName: "com.duckduckgo.Bitwarden-Proxy")
     connectionToService.remoteObjectInterface = NSXPCInterface(with: Bitwarden_ProxyProtocol.self)
     connectionToService.resume()

 Once you have a connection to the service, you can use it like this:

     if let proxy = connectionToService.remoteObjectProxy as? Bitwarden_ProxyProtocol {
         proxy.uppercase(string: "hello") { aString in
             NSLog("Result string was: \(aString)")
         }
     }

 And, when you are finished with the service, clean up the connection like this:

     connectionToService.invalidate()

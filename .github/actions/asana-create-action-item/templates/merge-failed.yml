      The <code>${TAG}</code> release has been successfully tagged and published in GitHub releases, 
      but merging to <code>${BASE_BRANCH}</code> failed. Please resolve conflicts and merge <code>${BRANCH}</code> to <code>${BASE_BRANCH}</code> manually.


      Issue the following git commands:
      <ul>
        <li><code>git fetch origin</code></li>
        <li><code>git checkout ${BRANCH}</code> switch to the release branch</li>
        <li><code>git pull origin ${BRANCH}</code> pull latest changes</li>
        <li><code>git checkout ${BASE_BRANCH}</code> switch to ${BASE_BRANCH}</li>
        <li><code>git pull origin ${BASE_BRANCH}</code> pull the latest code</li>
        <li><code>git merge ${BRANCH}</code>
          <ul>
            <li>Resolve conflicts as needed</li>
            <li>When merging a hotfix branch into an internal release branch, you will get conflicts in version and build number xcconfig files:
              <ul>
                <li>In the version file: accept the internal version number (higher).</li>
                <li>In the build number file: accept the hotfix build number (higher). This step is very important in order to calculate the build number of the next internal release correctly.</li>
              </ul></li>
          </ul></li>
        <li><code>git push origin ${BASE_BRANCH}</code> push merged branch</li>
      </ul>
      Complete this task when ready and proceed with testing the build. If you're bumping an internal release, you should get another task asking you to publish the release in Sparkle. 
      Look for other tasks in <a data-asana-gid='${AUTOMATION_TASK_ID}'/> task and handle them as needed.
